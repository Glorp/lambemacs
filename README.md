# Lambdas, things, ...

If you run a reasonably recent Emacs with `HOME`-environment variable set to this directory, then you it should lambda the Emacs. Requires [Standard ML](http://www.smlnj.org/). Like probably nice if it's available in `PATH` and you can start it with `sml`. (It works with SML/NJ. Maybe it works with other SMLs, but that's like impossible to know.)

It:
* randomly overrides probably really useful Emacs keybindings with generally less useful ones
* lets you do some lambda stuff hopefully (it should open a buffer with like mild instructions in it when starting)
* ~~a capybara~~an otter
  * or: a pretty neat error, if your Emacs doesn't png-support
