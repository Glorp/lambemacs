so I think the story kind of goes
Church made lambda calculus, for to use as logic and things
Kleene and Rosser proved that it was inconsistent

"in the sense that every forumula in their notation is
provable, irrespective of its meaning under the
interpretation intended for the symbols"

which probably involves like terms that have no "solution"
like if you try to reduce them you can go on like forever

I guess we could like read what they wrote
